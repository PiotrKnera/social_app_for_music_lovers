The aim of the diploma thesis was to develop and implement a web application opened with a web browser adjusted to the screen size of many devices such as a phone, tablet or laptop. The above system consists of a server part written in PHP and a client part based on technologies: HTML, CSS with Bootstrap library and JavaScript with jQuery library. The application enriched with the AJAX technique allows you to interact with the server without refreshing the page, in an asynchronous manner.

The aforementioned IT platform is divided into three sections and is designed to fulfill three main functions. The first one is the exchange or rental of musical instruments, which can have a positive impact on the home budget and even the ecology due to the reduction of the amount of discarded musical instruments. Another function is to advertise the services of music bands or solo musicians, through which they could gain more opportunities and work more often, and users would be able to easily find their favorite musician for a special event. Thanks to the last function, that is posting music tracks on an internet portal, the probability of discovering new talents would increase, filmmakers would find something for their productions faster, and beginning musicians would get a chance to show off their skills samples and additional advertising.
